{100}{}{You see a bored person dressed in leather armor.}
{101}{}{You see Max, the caravan guard.}
{102}{}{You see a dusty, bored person wearing leather armor. From the brahmin stench and the confident
 walk, this person is clearly a caravan guard.}

{103}{}{Can I help you with something?}
{104}{}{Urg?}
{105}{}{Ny work here!}
{106}{}{Who are you?}
{107}{}{What can you tell me about Chad?}

{108}{}{I got no patience for idiots. Sorry, pal, but you'll have to find someone else to play with.}
{109}{}{::sniff::}

{110}{}{I'm Max. I'm one of the caravan guards.}
{111}{}{What can you tell me about Chad?}
{112}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

{113}{}{I don't like him much. He seems to get always some extra money from his caravan jobs. It's really unfair.}
{114}{}{Well, Marcus suspects that he is skimming some of the money that supposed to go Broken Hills.}
{115}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

{116}{}{Thanks. I'm sure glad that this is over. You better watch your back thought.}
{117}{}{Bye.}

{118}{}{It's the enemy! Die!}
{119}{}{Oops.}

{120}{}{(Lowers his voice and looks around) That's gotta be it. I once saw myself that he was taking some "slice" of that money he got from uranium shipment from Gecko.}
{121}{}{Really? Then why you haven't tell about it to Marcus then?}

{122}{}{Are you duff? If I go to tell it, a lot of people in this town won't even look at me. Besides I might get some kind of revenge.}
{123}{}{Hmm, I could tell it about to Marcus, cause I don't plan to stay here too long anyway.}

{124}{}{Ok. Do what you want, but don't tell anything about me. And we never had this conversation, ok?}
{125}{}{Don't worry, I don't want to get you in any trouble, bye.}
