#   PERK DESCRIPTIONS
#
{1101}{}{Com Consciência, você terá informações detalhadas sobre qualquer criatura que você examine. Você vê seus pontos de vida exatos e com informações sobre qualquer arma que eles estão equipados.}
{1102}{}{You have learned the secret arts of the East, or you just punch faster. In any case, your hand-to-hand or melee attacks cost 1 AP less to perform.}
{1103}{}{Experience in unarmed combat has given you the edge when it comes to damage. You cause +2 points of damage with hand-to-hand and melee attacks for each level of this Perk.}
{1104}{}{For each level of Bonus Move, you get 2 free APs each turn that can only be used for movement. In other words, you can move 2 free hexes each turn for each level of this Perk.}
{1105}{}{Your training in firearms and other ranged weapons has made you more deadly in ranged combat. For each level of this Perk, you do +2 points of damage with ranged weapons.}
{1106}{}{This Perk allows you to pull the trigger a little faster and still remain as accurate as before. Each ranged weapon attack costs 1 AP less to perform.}
{1107}{}{You are more likely to move before your opponents in combat, since your Sequence is +2 for each level of this Perk.}
{1108}{}{With each level of this Perk, you get a +2 bonus to your Healing Rate. This is in addition to your normal healing rate, thus you heal faster.}
{1109}{}{You are more likely to cause critical hits in combat if you have this Perk. Each level of More Criticals gets you an additional +5% chance to cause a critical hit.}
{1110}{}{With the Night Vision Perk, you can see in the dark better. This will reduce the overall darkness level by 20%.}
{1111}{}{You command attention by just walking into a room. The initial reaction of another person is improved by 10% for each level of this Perk.}
{1112}{}{You are better able to avoid radiation and the bad effects radiation causes. Each level of this Perk improves your Radiation Resistance by 15%.}
{1113}{}{When you are tough, you take less damage. Each level of this Perk adds +10% to your general damage resistance.}
{1114}{}{AKA Mule. You can carry an additional 50 pounds of equipment for each level of this Perk.}
{1115}{}{You have a talent for hitting things at longer distances. For each level of this Perk, you get a +2 bonus to Perception for the purposes of determining range modifiers. It's easier than ever to kill at long range!}
{1116}{}{With this Perk, you now have the ability to move quickly and still remain quiet. You can Sneak and run at the same time. Without this Perk, you would automatically stop Sneaking if you ran.}
{1117}{}{You are a master of the outdoors. This Perk confers the ability to survive in hostile environments. You get a +25% bonus to Outdoorsman.}
{1118}{}{You have mastered one aspect of bartering - buying goods far more cheaply than normal. With this Perk, you get a 25% discount when purchasing items from a store or another trader.}
{1119}{}{Each level of Educated adds +2 skill points when you gain a new experience level. This Perk works best when purchased early in your adventure.}
{1120}{}{The healing of bodies comes easier to you with this Perk. Each level of this Perk heals 4-10 additional hit points when using the First Aid or Doctor skills.}
{1121}{}{You have the talent of finding money. You find additional money in random encounters in the desert.}
{1122}{}{The critical hits you cause in combat are more devastating. You gain a 20% bonus on the critical hit table, almost ensuring that more damage will be done. This does not affect the chance to cause a critical hit.}
{1123}{}{You have studied other human beings, giving you inside knowledge of their emotional reaction to you. You will see the reaction level of the person you are talking to when involved in an indepth conversation.}
{1124}{}{The Slayer walks the earth! In hand-to-hand combat all of your hits are upgraded to critical hits, causing destruction and mayhem.}
{1125}{}{You have mastered the firearm as a source of pain. With this Perk, any successful hit in combat with a ranged weapon will be upgraded to a critical hit if you also make a Luck roll.}
{1126}{}{While Sneaking, if you hit a critter in the back, you will cause double damage using a hand-to-hand attack. Silent Death is that kind of Perk.}
{1127}{}{Each level of Action Boy (insert Girl if you wish) gives you an additional AP to spend every combat turn. You can use these generic APs on any task.}
{1128}{}{Mental Block is the ability to tune out any outside mental interference. You must have learned this talent from a passing guru, or from a really late night at a bar.}
{1129}{}{With each level of this Perk, you gain an additional 4 Hit Points every time you advance a level. This is in addition to the hit points you already gain per level based off of your endurance.}
{1130}{}{You are less likely to be hit in combat if you have this Perk. You gain a +5 to your Armor Class, in addition to the AC bonus from any armor worn.}
{1131}{}{Yum! Tastes like chicken. For each level of this Perk, you gain +25% to your Poison Resistance.}
{1132}{}{This Perk will give you a one-time bonus of +10% to the Repair and Science skills. A little late night cramming never hurt anybody, especially you.}
{1133}{}{The Medic Perk gives you a one-time bonus of +10% to the First Aid and Doctor skills. Healing skills are a good thing.}
{1134}{}{A Master Thief is proficient at stealing and picking locks. You gain +15 to Stealing and Lockpicking. Steal from the rich, and give to you.}
{1135}{}{Being a Speaker means you have a one-time bonus of +20% to Speech. From the mouth of babes and all that.}
{1136}{}{Each level of the Heave Ho! Perk gives you an additional +2 to Strength (up to 10,) for purposes of determining range with thrown weapons only. This Perk will not exceed a weapon's maximum range.}
{1137}{}{ERROR.UNIMPED!}
{1138}{}{You are much more adept at stealing than the normal crook. You can steal with the best of them, because with this Perk, you ignore size and facing modifiers when stealing from a person.}
{1139}{}{When the sun goes down or you are in a poorly lit area, you move like a ghost with this Perk. Your Sneak skill is enhanced +20% in dark conditions.}
{1140}{}{Your reputation is always positive to people. Without this Perk, a large negative reputation would have a bad effect on good natured people. This works in the reverse as well. Evil people will even treat Mr. Goodie Good as one of the gang.}
{1141}{}{You can find more ammo than the normal post-holocaust survivor. This Perk doubles the amount of ammo found in random encounters.}
{1142}{}{The mark of the Explorer is to search out new and interesting locations. With this Perk, you have a greater chance of finding special places and people.}
{1143}{}{With this Perk, you are less likely to be addicted to chems (50% less likely, actually), and you suffer half the withdrawal time of a normal person.}
{1144}{}{The Pathfinder is better able to find the shortest route. With this Perk, your travel time on the World Map is reduced by 25% for each level.}
{1145}{}{Animals will not attack one of their friends, unless the animal is threatened or attacked first. Exactly what an animal is in this world is open to debate.}
{1146}{}{You have improved your ability to see distant locations, increasing the size of explorations on the World Map by one square in each direction. You also have a better chance of finding special encounters.}
{1147}{}{With this Perk, you have gained the attention of a Mysterious Stranger, who will appear to help you from time to time. If your ally is lost in combat, do not expect him (or her) to be replaced.}
{1148}{}{You gain a +15% toward your Outdoorsman skill. You are more likely to avoid random encounters if you choose, and tend to find those "special" encounters more than most.}
{1149}{}{You have learned to pack your equipment better. Accessing your inventory only costs you 2 Action Points in Combat instead of 4.}
{1150}{}{You have learned to increase your dialog options without understanding what you're talking about. Each level of this Perk will increase your Intelligence by one, up to 10, for purposes of dialog only.}
{1151}{}{You are indeed a Swift Learner with this Perk, as each level gives you an additional +5% bonus whenever you earn experience points. This is best taken early.}
{1152}{}{Your skills have improved to the point where you can pick an additional Tag Skill. Tag skills increase twice as fast.}
{1153}{}{The radiation of the wasteland has changed you! One of your Traits has mutated into something else...}
{1154}{}{You crave another Nuka-Cola.}
{1155}{}{You've got the shakes.}
